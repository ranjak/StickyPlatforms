	First milestone has been reached (having a player-controlled entity on screen,
	and the basic skeleton of the program).
	This week: enrich the game, start making actual gameplay.
	Current idea is a 2D platformer.
	Milestone for week's end: have a playable platforming level. Scrolling is a plus, but not required.
