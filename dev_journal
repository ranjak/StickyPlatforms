	First milestone has been reached (having a player-controlled entity on screen,
	and the basic skeleton of the program).
	This week: enrich the game, start making actual gameplay.
	Current idea is a 2D platformer.
	Milestone for week's end: have a playable platforming level. Scrolling is a plus, but not required.

	POC collision detection mechanism implemented.
	Tinkering about what to do with physics:
	Should I use a "realistic" newtonian approach, or something more focused on my current use case?
	1. Newtonian is probably more extensible, and could make more intersesting things possible "for free" once it's in place. However, it looks difficult to implement correctly; in particular, it is probably difficult to have it cater to the needs of a platformer with tight, responsive controls.
	2. On the other hand, an ad-hoc solution could be more straightforward to implement initially, be more predictable and thus easier to deal with gameplay-wise. The downside being that it would need more work down the line in case I'd want richer physics interactions in the game.

	I've started working on soution #1 on the "physics" branch, but all things considered I'm probably going to scrap it and start working on solution #2 instead.
