# StickyPlatforms

A basic 2D platformer to get some experience with game development.

## Requirements

SDL2, SDL2\_image, SDL2\_ttf, CMake.

A C++ compiler that supports C++11.

## Building

### Linux

Make sure you have installed development libraries for SDL2, SDL2\_image and SDL2\_ttf.

Then, for a standard in-source build, navigate to the source tree and run:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path to a destination folder for the game> ..
make
make install
```

You need to install the game so that it can load the resources it needs.
Installation destination does not matter, you can set the install prefix to anywhere you want.

__AppImage Notes__: I have made a set of scripts to build an AppImage for the game, targeting Ubuntu 12.04.  
The AppImage should be able to run on most distributions.  
I have noticed a problem with the SDL2 bundled in the AppImage on Fedora running on an Asus Zenbook laptop,
where key repeat events would be detected as regular key events. To fix this, SDL2 needs to be built with `ibus` support.
For reference, the `ibus` version on Fedora 25 at the time of testing was 1.5.14.

### Windows (MSVC)

In CMake, before configuring the project, add a variable `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` pointing to the root folder where SDL2, SDL2\_image  and SDL2\_ttf libraries are located
(the folder should contain `lib` and `include` subfolders).

Set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to the directory where you want the game to be installed.

You can then proceed to configure, generate the project, and build the `INSTALL` target in Visual Studio.

### Other

So far, the game has been tested on Linux and Windows only, but it should work at least on Mac as well.

## How To Play

  * __Run__: Left/Right arrow keys
  * __Jump__: Space key. How long you hold the key down will influence your jump height.
  * __Sword__: F key
  * __Climb a ledge__: Hold the direction corresponding to the ledge you are facing (or hold Space).
  * __Cling to decor__: Hold _Jump_ while in the air to cling to horizontal decor elements you come in contact with.
  * __Climb onto a platform__: While clinging to a platform, press the Up arrow key to climb on top of it.
  * __Wall Jump__: While in the air and in contact with a wall, hold the direction opposite to the wall and press _Jump_ to perform a wall jump.
  
  * __Pause__: Escape
  * __Toggle fullscreen__: Alt + Return
  * __Quit__: Standard quit shortcut (Alt + F4 / Cmd + Q)
