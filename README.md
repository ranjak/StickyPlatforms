# game1

A basic 2D platformer to get some experience with game development.

## Requirements

SDL2, SDL2\_image, CMake.

A C++ compiler that supports C++11.

## Building

### Linux

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Windows (MSVC)

In CMake, before configuring the project, add a variable `SDL2_PATH` pointing to the root folder where SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries are located
(the folder should contain `lib` and `Ã¬nclude` subfolders).
You can then proceed to configure, generate and build the project in Visual Studio.

### Other

So far, the game has been tested on Linux and Windows only, but it should work at least on Mac as well.

## Running

When running the game, make sure your working directory is the source directory, where the `assets` folder is, otherwise the game won't find it.

Use the arrow keys to move around, and Space to jump. Use 'C' to swing your sword.
You're the green block, the enemy is the red one. Beware, as he will hurt you on contact. Hit him with your sword to defend yourself!
