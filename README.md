# game1

A basic 2D platformer to get some experience with game development.

## Requirements

SDL2, SDL2\_image, CMake.

A C++ compiler that supports C++11.

## Building

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

So far, the game has been tested on Linux only, but it should work at least on Windows and Mac as well.

## Running

When running the game, make sure your working directory is the source directory, where the `assets` folder is, otherwise the game won't find it.

## License
